TODO Item

Documentation:  Document the different imagery formats we need.]
how are the sentinel images stored for coastsat?
What format do we get images from earthcache?
What format do we need to do upsampling?

We want to be able to convert images back and forth easily.  It is likely something like this already exists in a python library
